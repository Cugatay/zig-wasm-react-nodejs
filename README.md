# Zig WASM in React

Hello there! Finding a codebase and documentation about something that very small percentage of people tries is the hardest thing to do in Zig Language, since the language both lacks rich documentations and it changes like, everyday!

But on the bright side, this is a good thing for an evolving and developing language, and the hardest thing being just that is also great, because that means the language itself is very well designed, so you can understand even the hardest concepts via just surfing around the codebase.

Therefore, with this repository I aim to share the way you can create WASM files that are reaaaally small (in my experiences, it was smaller than Rust ðŸ˜²) and blazingly fast! This way, you can turn a shitty language called TypeScript and its one of the most popular framework called React into something amazing! Or you can use the `nodejs/index.ts` file as a reference for using WASM for also backend stuff!

Note: Zig part of this project has been tested with Zig versions `0.13` and `0.14.0-dev.571+f4f5b2bc4`

# Installing

After cloning the repository, you can use `bun install`, `pnpm install` or anything you want, but I initially worked with bun, which is written in Zig btw, lets go Zig!

For me, the most important part of the project is building the Zig in a way that it produces a freestanding binary, with all the functions you want to export, and in a small size. So, finding the way to do these 3 things at the same time was a little hard, spent a day with Reddit and YouTube, but here is the shell command for building the binary:

```bash
zig build-exe src/main.zig -target wasm32-freestanding -fno-entry -rdynamic -OReleaseSmall
```

# Important Notes

After building it, `main.wasm` file is being generated on the root folder, to use it with React, you should move it to `/react/public/main.wasm`

And then, I use React and useEffect hook to fetch main.wasm, give some function to Zig so it can perform JavaScript whenever we need and set functions state to the exported functions from Zig so we can use it outside of the hook.

And the most important thing is: Don't use a state for only a function! So, I'm doing this: `setWasmExports(exports);` And I mean don't do this: `setAddFunction(result.exports.add as AddFunc);` This doesn't work, because WASM needs a memory to perform. And the `wasmExports` state is not just a set of functions that are exported from Wasm. There's also a variable called memory that you can see on `WASMFunctions` interface.

Normally, you don't have to specify `memory: WebAssembly.Memory;` in the interface, but since this is a documentation, I wanted to show this memory variable explicitly.

The nodejs.ts file works just fine, no need to do anything! But just one important note: Calling a function in Nodejs and React differs in a small way:

#### React:

```Typescript
...
}).then((result) => {
    const exports = result.exports as unknown as WASMFunctions;
...
```

#### NodeJS:

```Typescript
...
}).then((result) => {
  const add = result.instance.exports.add as Add;
...
```

So, you gotta add result.instance before getting exports. Just keep that in mind!

# The End

Now, what you have in your hands are:

- A fast main.wasm file
- A great and Ziggy developer experience
- A WASM file that is even smaller than 1 byte
- React and NodeJS projects that work with WASM

Thanks for giving a chance to this piece of code!
